History
=======

3.0.1
-----
2019-08-21

Behind the scenes, changed how key's are generated from task function and arguments.
No longer uses ``inspect.getcallargs`` (deprecrated) and is stored on ``__init__``.
Should fix issues if tasks are wrapped by other libraries (i.e. sentry-python).

3.0.0
-----
2019-05-13

Fixed an issue where large/long arguments could cause ``OSError Filename too long`` with the file backend (see #96).
Keys generated for file backend, are now hashed and limited to 50 characters in length.
*Due to this, it is not backwards compatible with existing keys from the file backend, so any pending locks from previous version will be ignored.*
The Redis backend is unchanged, and thus fully compatible.

Credit for fix to @xuhcc.

2.1.2
-----
2019-05-13

- Add support for ``rediss``. Thanks @gustavoalmeida

2.1.1
-----
2019-05-08

- Fix an issue with the ``File`` backend (#89) to close file after creation, else unclosed file descriptors eventually lead to an "Too many open files" error. Thanks @xuhcc.

2.1.0
-----
2019-02-25

- Added ``File`` backend (#84). Credit and thanks to @xuhcc.

2.0.1
-----
2019-02-25

- Fixed an issue when using ``autoretry_for`` with a task. (#74, #75). Thanks @pkariz.

2.0.0
-----

2018-04-25

Major Release:

This changes the Redis backend to use a SETNX-based lock (RedLock). This should address race conditions that the previous approach had (See: #7, #60).

*This may not be backwards compatible with existing keys stored in Redis.*
If you are upgrading from `1.0.0`, it may be safer to remove any previous used lock keys (See https://github.com/cameronmaske/celery-once/pull/67#issuecomment-384281438 for instructions).

Other changes include:

    - Able to run on blocking mode when scheduling tasks with Redis backend. See the README for more details.

    - ``AlreadyQueued`` exception return's countdown seconds as `float` instead of `int`.

Big thanks to @grjones for his contributions for this patch.
